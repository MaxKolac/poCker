# poCker
A text-based customizable game of Texas Hold 'em Poker running within a console with rules based on [Rules of Hold 'em Poker for Computers (and people too!)](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~ferguson/poker/rules.html) by George Ferguson and Chris Brown.
A backup of the linked page is available in the root folder of this repo [here](https://github.com/MaxKolac/poCker/blob/main/rules-guide.html).

Project I started in order to learn the C language through a practical crash course.
